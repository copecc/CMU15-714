### 10-414/714: Deep Learning Systems

Deep learning methods have revolutionized Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in recent years. While deep learning systems like PyTorch and TensorFlow are widely available, understanding their internals at a fundamental level is less common but crucial for effective use and extension. This course provides students with a comprehensive understanding of the “full stack” of deep learning systems, from high-level modeling design to automatic differentiation implementation to device-level efficient algorithms. Throughout the course, students will design and build from scratch a complete deep learning library (called “Needle” - Necessary Elements of Deep Learning), capable of efficient GPU-based operations, automatic differentiation, and support for parameterized layers, loss functions, data loaders, and optimizers. Using these tools, students will implement state-of-the-art modeling methods including convolutional networks, recurrent networks, self-attention models, and generative models.
